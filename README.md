# Sales Performance Dashboard with Predictive Analytics

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical sales data, visualizes key performance metrics, and implements a predictive model to forecast future sales. The analysis is done in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), and the results are visualized in Power BI for an interactive dashboard.

## Features

1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize trends, seasonality, and correlations.

3.Predictive Modeling: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost) to forecast sales.

4.Power BI Dashboard: Connect processed data to Power BI for interactive visualizations.

# Tech Stack

## Python Libraries:

1.Pandas (Data Manipulation)

2.NumPy (Numerical Operations)

3.Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)

4.Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)

# Dashboarding: Power BI
